This folder contains representative motion capture data files used in the paper:

**Marker-based Mouse MoCap**
*Published in eNeuro, 2025*

## Contents
- Example motion capture files in MATLAB format for a single animal, under various behavioral contexts:
  - Open field, VEHICLE administration: MOS1aD_S33_M5_MC2_T2_FL2_2023-04-25_A2.mat
  - Open field, CP55,940 administration:MOS1aD_S15_M5_MC2_T2_FL2_2023-04-14_B.mat
  - Open field, HARMALINE administration: MOS1aD_S02_M5_MC2_T2_FL2_2023-04-07_E.mat
  - Climbing, VEHICLE administration:MOS1aD_S33_M5_MC2_T2_CLB_2023-04-25_A2.mat
  - Climbing, CP55,940 administration: MOS1aD_S15_M5_MC2_T2_CLB_2023-04-14_B.mat
  - Treadmill, 20m/min, VEHICLE administration: MOS1aD_S33_M5_MC2_T1_TRM_20MMIN_A2.mat
  - Treadmill, 15m/min, CP55,940 administration: MOS1aD_S15_M5_MC2_T2_TRM_15MMIN_B.mat
  - Treadmill, 5m/min, HARMALINE administration: MOS1aD_S2_M5_MC2_T2_TRM_5MMIN_E.mat

- Data is provided for a single animal (M5_MC2), under VEHICLE, CP55,940 and HARMALINE conditions.
- HARMALINE data is not provided for climbing task because animals refused to climb.

These files are intended as an example of the general format of data.
