*Published in eNeuro, 2025*

## Video List and Captions

- **Video_1_BIJ2025.mp4**  
  Raw 3D reconstruction of marker positions during open field exploration shown in real time. Red color of a marker indicates break in automatic tracking.

- **Video_2_BIJ2025.mp4**  
  Video and motion capture reconstructions of full 1-min trials involving open field exploration in the same mouse treated with vehicle and CP55,940.

- **Video_3_BIJ2025.mp4**  
  Video and motion capture reconstructions of full 1-min trials involving voluntary wheel climbing in the same mouse treated with vehicle and CP55,940.

- **Video_4_BIJ2025.mp4**  
  Video and motion capture reconstructions of full 30-s trials involving running on a motorized treadmill, in the same mouse treated with vehicle and CP55,940. Two highest speeds this mouse reached are shown for both conditions.

- **Video_5_BIJ2025.mp4**  
  Close-up video and motion capture reconstruction for two segments of high-speed running on a treadmill.

- **Video_6_BIJ2025.mp4**  
  Video and motion capture reconstructions of a full 30-s trial of a single mouse running on treadmill at various speeds.

- **Video_7_BIJ2025.mp4**  
  Close-up motion capture reconstruction of a segment of high-speed running (40 m/min treadmill speed), in normal speed and slowed-down to 20%.

- **Video_8_BIJ2025.mp4**  
  Close-up motion capture reconstruction of raw, unprocessed marker positions during a full 1-min recording of a mouse under harmaline influence. Text in upper right corner indicates gaps in marker tracking.

- **Video_9_BIJ2025.mp4**  
  Close-up motion capture reconstruction of raw, unprocessed marker positions in a mouse under harmaline influence, shown slowed down to 20%. Text in upper right corner indicates gaps in marker tracking.

- **Video_10_BIJ2025.mp4**  
  Video and motion capture reconstructions of full 1-min trials involving open field exploration in the same mouse treated with vehicle and harmaline.

- **Video_11_BIJ2025.mp4**  
  Video and motion capture reconstructions of full 1-min trials involving wheel climbing in the same mouse treated with vehicle and harmaline.

- **Video_12_BIJ2025.mp4**  
  Video and motion capture reconstructions of a full 30-s trial of a single mouse locomoting on treadmill at various speeds under harmaline influence.

- **Video_13_BIJ2025.mp4**  
  Video and motion capture reconstructions of mice locomoting with forelimb or headplate trackers.
