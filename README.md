# Marker-based Mouse MoCap (eNeuro 2025)

**Accurate tracking of locomotory kinematics in mice moving freely in three-dimensional environments**

This repository accompanies our paper published in **eNeuro (2025)** describing a robust and precise marker-based motion capture (MoCap) method for analyzing mouse locomotion in 3D.

## Overview

We developed and validated a high-resolution, marker-based motion capture system capable of tracking full-body kinematics of freely moving mice with sub-millimeter accuracy. The approach is especially suited to studying detailed locomotor behavior and subtle motor phenotypes, providing insights into complex motor control and neuroscience.

## Repository Structure

* `code/`: Matlab and Python code for processing and analyzing MoCap data.
* `data/`: Small sample datasets for immediate use and code demonstration (full datasets are bring made available on Zenodo).
* `docs/`: Additional documentation, guidelines, and supplementary material.

## Raw Data Access

Complete raw experimental data (large datasets) are deposited and accessible via Zenodo:
