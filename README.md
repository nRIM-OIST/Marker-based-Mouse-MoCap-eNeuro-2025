## Overview

We developed and validated a high-resolution, marker-based motion capture system capable of tracking full-body kinematics of freely moving mice with sub-millimeter accuracy. The approach is especially suited to studying detailed locomotor behavior and subtle motor phenotypes, providing insights into complex motor control and neuroscience.
